They click upon themselves\nAs the breeze rises, and turn many-colored\nAs the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.\nSoon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells\nShattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—\nSuch heaps of broken glass to sweep away\nYou'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.\nThey are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,\nAnd they seem not to break; though once they are bowed\nSo low for long, they never right themselves:\nYou may see their trunks arching in the woods\nYears afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground\nLike girls on hands and knees that throw their hair\nBefore them over their heads to dry in the sun.\nBut I was going to say when Truth broke in\nWith all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm\nI should prefer to have some boy bend them\nAs he went out and in to fetch the cows—\nSome boy too far from town to learn baseball,\nWhose only play was what he found himself,\nSummer or winter, and could play alone.\nOne by one he subdued his father's trees\nBy riding them down over and over again\nUntil he took the stiffness out of them,\nAnd not one but hung limp, not one was left\nFor him to conquer. He learned all there was\nTo learn about not launching out too soon\nAnd so not carrying the tree away\nClear to the ground. He always kept his poise\nTo the top branches, climbing carefully\nWith the same pains you use to fill a cup\nUp to the brim, and even above the brim.\nThen he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,\nKicking his way down through the air to the ground.\nSo was I once myself a swinger of birches.\nAnd so I dream of going back to be.\nIt's when I'm weary of considerations,\nAnd life is too much like a pathless wood\nWhere your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs\nBroken across it, and one eye is weeping\nFrom a twig's having lashed across it open.\nI'd like to get away from earth awhile\nAnd then come back to it and begin over.\nMay no fate willfully misunderstand me\nAnd half grant what I wish and snatch me away\nNot to return. Earth's the right place for love:\nI don't know where it's likely to go better.\nI'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,\nAnd climb black branches up a snow-white trunk\nToward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,\nBut dipped its top and set me down again.\nThat would be good both going and coming back.\nOne could do worse than be a swinger of birches."}

You can be certain,\nWhen he begins like that, there’s someone at him\nTrying to coax him off with pocket-money,—\nIn haying time, when any help is scarce.\nIn winter he comes back to us. I’m done.’\n\n‘Sh! not so loud: he’ll hear you,’ Mary said.\n\n‘I want him to: he’ll have to soon or late.’\n\n‘He’s worn out. He’s asleep beside the stove.\nWhen I came up from Rowe’s I found him here,\nHuddled against the barn-door fast asleep,\nA miserable sight, and frightening, too—\nYou needn’t smile—I didn’t recognize him—\nI wasn’t looking for him—and he’s changed.\nWait till you see.’\n\n‘Where did you say he’d been?’\n\n‘He didn’t say.

Did he say anything?’\n\n‘But little.’\n\n‘Anything? Mary, confess\nHe said he’d come to ditch the meadow for me.’\n\n‘Warren!’\n\n‘But did he? I just want to know.’\n\n‘Of course he did. What would you have him say?\nSurely you wouldn’t grudge the poor old man\nSome humble way to save his self-respect.\nHe added, if you really care to know,\nHe meant to clear the upper pasture, too.\nThat sounds like something you have heard before?\nWarren, I wish you could have heard the way\nHe jumbled everything. I stopped to look\nTwo or three times—he made me feel so queer—\nTo see if he was talking in his sleep.\nHe ran on Harold Wilson—you remember—\nThe boy you had in haying four years since.\nHe’s finished school, and teaching in his college.\nSilas declares you’ll have to get him back.\nHe says they two will make a team for work:\nBetween them they will lay this farm as smooth!\nThe way he mixed that in with other things.\nHe thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft\nOn education—you know how they fought\nAll through July under the blazing sun,\nSilas up on the cart to build the load,\nHarold along beside to pitch it on.’\n\n‘Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.’\n\n‘Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.\nYou wouldn’t think they would. How some things linger!\nHarold’s young college boy’s assurance piqued him.\nAfter so many years he still keeps finding\nGood arguments he sees he might have used.\nI sympathize. I know just how it feels\nTo think of the right thing to say too late.\nHarold’s associated in his mind with Latin.\nHe asked me what I thought of Harold’s saying\nHe studied Latin like the violin\nBecause he liked it—that an argument!\nHe said he couldn’t make the boy believe\nHe could find water with a hazel prong—\nWhich showed how much good school had ever done him.\nHe wanted to go over that. But most of all\nHe thinks if he could have another chance\nTo teach him how to build a load of hay—’\n\n‘I know, that’s Silas’ one accomplishment.\nHe bundles every forkful in its place,\nAnd tags and numbers it for future reference,\nSo he can find and easily dislodge it\nIn the unloading. Silas does that well.\nHe takes it out in bunches like big birds’ nests.\nYou never see him standing on the hay\nHe’s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.’\n\n‘He thinks if he could teach him that, he’d be\nSome good perhaps to someone in the world.\nHe hates to see a boy the fool of books.\nPoor Silas, so concerned for other folk,\nAnd nothing to look backward to with pride,\nAnd nothing to look forward to with hope,\nSo now and never any different.’\n\nPart of a moon was falling down the west,\nDragging the whole sky with it to the hills.\nIts light poured softly in her lap.

Thirteen little miles\nAs the road winds would bring him to his door.\nSilas has walked that far no doubt today.\nWhy didn’t he go there? His brother’s rich,\nA somebody—director in the bank.’\n\n‘He never told us that.’\n\n‘We know it though.’\n\n‘I think his brother ought to help, of course.\nI’ll see to that if there is need. He ought of right\nTo take him in, and might be willing to—\nHe may be better than appearances.\nBut have some pity on Silas.

the dead?\nAnd if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?\nAnd if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?\n\n2\n\nThe love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account,\nThat of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.\n\nThe expression of the face balks account,\nBut the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,\nIt is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists,\nIt is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him,\nThe strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,\nTo see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,\nYou linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.\n\nThe sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards,\nThe swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water,\nThe bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle,\nGirls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,\nThe group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,\nThe female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard,\nThe young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd,\nThe wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work,\nThe coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,\nThe upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;\nThe march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,\nThe slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,\nThe natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting;\nSuch-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child,\nSwim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count.\n\n3\n\nI knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,\nAnd in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.\n\nThis man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,\nThe shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners,\nThese I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,\nHe was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,\nThey and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,\nThey did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,\nHe drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face,\nHe was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,\nWhen he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,\nYou would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.\n\n4\n\nI have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough,\nTo stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,\nTo be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,\nTo pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then?\nI do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea.\n\nThere is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well,\nAll things please the soul, but these please the soul well.\n\n5\n\nThis is the female form,\nA divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,\nIt attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,\nI am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it,\nBooks, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed,\nMad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable,\nHair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused,\nEbb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching,\nLimitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice,\nBridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,\nUndulating into the willing and yielding day,\nLost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day.\n\nThis the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman,\nThis the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again.\n\nBe not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest,\nYou are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.\n\nThe female contains all qualities and tempers them,\nShe is in her place and moves with perfect balance,\nShe is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active,\nShe is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.\n\nAs I see my soul reflected in Nature,\nAs I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty,\nSee the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see.\n\n6\n\nThe male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,\nHe too is all qualities, he is action and power,\nThe flush of the known universe is in him,\nScorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,\nThe wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him,\nThe full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,\nKnowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself,\nWhatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here,\n(Where else does he strike soundings except here?)\n\nThe man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred,\nNo matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang?\nIs it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?\nEach belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you,\nEach has his or her place in the procession.\n\n(All is a procession,\nThe universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)\n\nDo you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?\nDo you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight?\nDo you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,\nFor you only, and not for him and her?\n\n7\n\nA man’s body at auction,\n(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,)\nI help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business.\n\nGentlemen look on this wonder,\nWhatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it,\nFor it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant,\nFor it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll’d.\n\nIn this head the all-baffling brain,\nIn it and below it the makings of heroes.\n\nExamine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve,\nThey shall be stript that you may see them.\n\nExquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,\nFlakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs,\nAnd wonders within there yet.\n\nWithin there runs blood,\nThe same old blood! the same red-running blood!\nThere swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations,\n(Do you think they are not there because they are not express’d in parlors and lecture-rooms?)\n\nThis is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns,\nIn him the start of populous states and rich republics,\nOf him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.\n\nHow do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries?\n(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?)\n\n8\n\nA woman’s body at auction,\nShe too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers,\nShe is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers.\n\nHave you ever loved the body of a woman?\nHave you ever loved the body of a man?\nDo you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth?\n\nIf any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,\nAnd the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted,\nAnd in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the

The sounding cataract\nHaunted me like a passion: the tall rock,\nThe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\nTheir colours and their forms, were then to me\nAn appetite; a feeling and a love,\nThat had no need of a remoter charm,\nBy thought supplied, not any interest\nUnborrowed from the eye.—That time is past,\nAnd all its aching joys are now no more,\nAnd all its dizzy raptures. Not for this\nFaint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts\nHave followed; for such loss, I would believe,\nAbundant recompense. For I have learned\nTo look on nature, not as in the hour\nOf thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes\nThe still sad music of humanity,\nNor harsh nor grating, though of ample power\nTo chasten and subdue.—And I have felt\nA presence that disturbs me with the joy\nOf elevated thoughts; a sense sublime\nOf something far more deeply interfused,\nWhose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\nAnd the round ocean and the living air,\nAnd the blue sky, and in the mind of man:\nA motion and a spirit, that impels\nAll thinking things, all objects of all thought,\nAnd rolls through all things. Therefore am I still\nA lover of the meadows and the woods\nAnd mountains; and of all that we behold\nFrom this green earth; of all the mighty world\nOf eye, and ear,—both what they half create,\nAnd what perceive; well pleased to recognise\nIn nature and the language of the sense\nThe anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,\nThe guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul\nOf all my moral being.\n\nNor perchance,\nIf I were not thus taught, should I the more\nSuffer my genial spirits to decay:\nFor thou art with me here upon the banks\nOf this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,\nMy dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch\nThe language of my former heart, and read\nMy former pleasures in the shooting lights\nOf thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while\nMay I behold in thee what I was once,\nMy dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,\nKnowing that Nature never did betray\nThe heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,\nThrough all the years of this our life, to lead\nFrom joy to joy: for she can so inform\nThe mind that is within us, so impress\nWith quietness and beauty, and so feed\nWith lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,\nRash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,\nNor greetings where no kindness is, nor all\nThe dreary intercourse of daily life,\nShall e'er prevail against us, or disturb\nOur cheerful faith, that all which we behold\nIs full of blessings. Therefore let the moon\nShine on thee in thy solitary walk;\nAnd let the misty mountain-winds be free\nTo blow against thee: and, in after years,\nWhen these wild ecstasies shall be matured\nInto a sober pleasure; when thy mind\nShall be a mansion for all lovely forms,\nThy memory be as a dwelling-place\nFor all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,\nIf solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,\nShould be thy portion, with what healing thoughts\nOf tender joy wilt thou remember me,\nAnd these my exhortations! Nor, perchance—\nIf I should be where I no more can hear\nThy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams\nOf past existence—wilt thou then forget\nThat on the banks of this delightful stream\nWe stood together; and that I, so long\nA worshipper of Nature, hither came\nUnwearied in that service: rather say\nWith warmer love—oh! with far deeper zeal\nOf holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,\nThat after many wanderings, many years\nOf absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,\nAnd this green pastoral landscape, were to me\nMore dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!"}

For this, didst Thou,\nO Derwent! travelling over the green Plains\nNear my 'sweet Birthplace', didst thou, beauteous Stream\nMake ceaseless music through the night and day\nWhich with its steady cadence, tempering\nOur human waywardness, compos'd my thoughts\nTo more than infant softness, giving me,\nAmong the fretful dwellings of mankind,\nA knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm\nThat Nature breathes among the hills and groves.\nWhen, having left his Mountains, to the Towers\nOf Cockermouth that beauteous River came,\nBehind my Father's House he pass'd, close by,\nAlong the margin of our Terrace Walk.\nHe was a Playmate whom we dearly lov'd.\nOh! many a time have I, a five years' Child,\nA naked Boy, in one delightful Rill,\nA little Mill-race sever'd from his stream,\nMade one long bathing of a summer's day,\nBask'd in the sun, and plunged, and bask'd again\nAlternate all a summer's day, or cours'd\nOver the sandy fields, leaping through groves\nOf yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill,\nThe woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,\nWere bronz'd with a deep radiance, stood alone\nBeneath the sky, as if I had been born\nOn Indian Plains, and from my Mother's hut\nHad run abroad in wantonness, to sport,\nA naked Savage, in the thunder shower.\n\nFair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up\nFoster'd alike by beauty and by fear;\nMuch favour'd in my birthplace, and no less\nIn that beloved Vale to which, erelong,\nI was transplanted. Well I call to mind\n('Twas at an early age, ere I had seen\nNine summers) when upon the mountain slope\nThe frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp'd\nThe last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy\nTo wander half the night among the Cliffs\nAnd the smooth Hollows, where the woodcocks ran\nAlong the open turf. In thought and wish\nThat time, my shoulder all with springes hung,\nI was a fell destroyer. On the heights\nScudding away from snare to snare, I plied\nMy anxious visitation, hurrying on,\nStill hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars\nWere shining o'er my head; I was alone,\nAnd seem'd to be a trouble to the peace\nThat was among them. Sometimes it befel\nIn these night-wanderings, that a strong desire\nO'erpower'd my better reason, and the bird\nWhich was the captive of another's toils\nBecame my prey; and, when the deed was done\nI heard among the solitary hills\nLow breathings coming after me, and sounds\nOf undistinguishable motion, steps\nAlmost as silent as the turf they trod.\nNor less in springtime when on southern banks\nThe shining sun had from his knot of leaves\nDecoy'd the primrose flower, and when the Vales\nAnd woods were warm, was I a plunderer then\nIn the high places, on the lonesome peaks\nWhere'er, among the mountains and the winds,\nThe Mother Bird had built her lodge. Though mean\nMy object, and inglorious, yet the end\nWas not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung\nAbove the raven's nest, by knots of grass\nAnd half-inch fissures in the slippery rock\nBut ill sustain'd, and almost, as it seem'd,\nSuspended by the blast which blew amain,\nShouldering the naked crag; Oh! at that time,\nWhile on the perilous ridge I hung alone,\nWith what strange utterance did the loud dry wind\nBlow through my ears! the sky seem'd not a sky\nOf earth, and with what motion mov'd the clouds!\n\nThe mind of Man is fram'd even like the breath\nAnd harmony of music. There is a dark\nInvisible workmanship that reconciles\nDiscordant elements, and makes them move\nIn one society. Ah me! that all\nThe terrors, all the early miseries\nRegrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all\nThe thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd\nInto my mind, should ever have made up\nThe calm existence that is mine when I\nAm worthy of myself! Praise to the end!\nThanks likewise for the means! But I believe\nThat Nature, oftentimes, when she would frame\nA favor'd Being, from his earliest dawn\nOf infancy doth open out the clouds,\nAs at the touch of lightning, seeking him\nWith gentlest visitation; not the less,\nThough haply aiming at the self-same end,\nDoes it delight her sometimes to employ\nSeverer interventions, ministry\nMore palpable, and so she dealt with me.\n\nOne evening (surely I was led by her)\nI went alone into a Shepherd's Boat,\nA Skiff that to a Willow tree was tied\nWithin a rocky Cave, its usual home.\n'Twas by the shores of Patterdale, a Vale\nWherein I was a Stranger, thither come\nA School-boy Traveller, at the Holidays.\nForth rambled from the Village Inn alone\nNo sooner had I sight of this small Skiff,\nDiscover'd thus by unexpected chance,\nThan I unloos'd her tether and embark'd.\nThe moon was up, the Lake was shining clear\nAmong the hoary mountains; from the Shore\nI push'd, and struck the oars and struck again\nIn cadence, and my little Boat mov'd on\nEven like a Man who walks with stately step\nThough bent on speed. It was an act of stealth\nAnd troubled pleasure; not without the voice\nOf mountain-echoes did my Boat move on,\nLeaving behind her still on either side\nSmall circles glittering idly in the moon,\nUntil they melted all into one track\nOf sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose\nAbove the Cavern of the Willow tree\nAnd now, as suited one who proudly row'd\nWith his best skill, I fix'd a steady view\nUpon the top of that same craggy ridge,\nThe bound of the horizon, for behind\nWas nothing but the stars and the grey sky.\nShe was an elfin Pinnace; lustily\nI dipp'd my oars into the silent Lake,\nAnd, as I rose upon the stroke, my Boat\nWent heaving through the water, like a Swan;\nWhen from behind that craggy Steep, till then\nThe bound of the horizon, a huge Cliff,\nAs if with voluntary power instinct,\nUprear'd its head. I struck, and struck again\nAnd, growing still in stature, the huge Cliff\nRose up between me and the stars, and still,\nWith measur'd motion, like a living thing,\nStrode after me. With trembling hands I turn'd,\nAnd through the silent water stole my way\nBack to the Cavern of the Willow tree.\nThere, in her mooring-place, I left my Bark,\nAnd, through the meadows homeward went, with grave\nAnd serious thoughts; and after I had seen\nThat spectacle, for many days, my brain\nWork'd with a dim and undetermin'd sense\nOf unknown modes of being; in my thoughts\nThere was a darkness, call it solitude,\nOr blank desertion, no familiar shapes\nOf hourly objects, images of trees,\nOf sea or sky, no colours of green fields;\nBut huge and mighty Forms that do not live\nLike living men mov'd slowly through the mind\nBy day and were the trouble of my dreams.\n\nWisdom and Spirit of the universe!\nThou Soul that art the eternity of thought!\nThat giv'st to forms and images a breath\nAnd everlasting motion! not in vain,\nBy day or star-light thus from my first dawn\nOf Childhood didst Thou intertwine for me\nThe passions that build up our human Soul,\nNot with the mean and vulgar works of Man,\nBut with high objects, with enduring things,\nWith life and nature, purifying thus\nThe elements of feeling and of thought,\nAnd sanctifying, by such discipline,\nBoth pain and fear, until we recognize\nA grandeur in the beatings of the heart.\n\nNor was this fellowship vouchsaf'd to me\nWith stinted kindness. In November days,\nWhen vapours, rolling down the valleys, made\nA lonely scene more lonesome; among woods\nAt noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,\nWhen, by the margin of the trembling Lake,\nBeneath the gloomy hills I homeward went\nIn solitude, such intercourse was mine;\n'Twas mine among the fields both day and night,\nAnd by the waters all the summer long.\n\nAnd in the frosty season, when the sun\nWas set, and visible for many a mile\nThe cottage windows through the twilight blaz'd,\nI heeded not the summons:—happy time\nIt was, indeed, for all of us; to me\nIt was a time of rapture: clear and loud\nThe village clock toll'd six; I wheel'd about,\nProud and exulting, like an untired horse,\nThat cares not for its home.—All shod with steel,\nWe hiss'd along the polish'd ice, in games\nConfederate, imitative of the chace\nAnd woodland pleasures, the resounding horn,\nThe Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare.\nSo through the darkness and the cold we flew,\nAnd not a voice was idle; with the din,\nMeanwhile, the precipices rang aloud,\nThe leafless trees, and every icy crag\nTinkled like iron, while the distant hills\nInto the tumult sent an alien sound\nOf melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,\nEastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west\nThe orange sky of evening died away.\n\nNot seldom from the uproar I retired\nInto a silent bay, or sportively\nGlanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,\nTo cut across the image of a star\nThat gleam'd upon the ice: and oftentimes\nWhen we had given our bodies to the wind,\nAnd all the shadowy banks, on either side,\nCame sweeping through the darkness, spinning still\nThe rapid line of motion; then at once\nHave I, reclining back upon my heels,\nStopp'd short, yet still the solitary Cliffs\nWheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll'd\nWith visible motion her diurnal round;\nBehind me did they stretch in solemn train\nFeebler and feebler, and I stood and watch'd\nTill all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.\n\nYe Presences of Nature, in the sky\nAnd on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!\nAnd Souls of lonely places! can I think\nA vulgar hope was yours when Ye employ'd\nSuch ministry, when Ye through many a year\nHaunting me thus among my boyish sports,\nOn caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,\nImpress'd upon all forms the characters\nOf danger or desire, and thus did make\nThe surface of the universal earth\nWith triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear,\nWork like a sea?\n\nNot uselessly employ'd,\nI might pursue this theme through every change\nOf exercise and play, to which the year\nDid summon us in its delightful round.\n\nWe were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven\nBeheld not vales more beautiful than ours,\nNor saw a race in happiness and joy\nMore worthy of the ground where they were sown.\nI would record with no reluctant voice\nThe woods of autumn and their hazel bowers\nWith milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,\nTrue symbol of the foolishness of hope,\nWhich with its strong enchantment led us on\nBy rocks and pools, shut out from every star\nAll the green summer, to forlorn cascades\nAmong the windings of the mountain brooks.\n—Unfading recollections! at this hour\nThe heart is almost mine with which I felt\nFrom some hill-top, on sunny afternoons\nThe Kite high up among the fleecy clouds\nPull at its rein, like an impatient Courser,\nOr, from the meadows sent on gusty days,\nBeheld her breast the wind, then suddenly\nDash'd headlong; and rejected by the storm.\n\nYe lowly Cottages in which we dwelt,\nA ministration of your own was yours,\nA sanctity, a safeguard, and a love!\nCan I forget you, being as ye were\nSo beautiful among the pleasant fields\nIn which ye stood? Or can I here forget\nThe plain and seemly countenance with which\nYe dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye\nDelights and exultations of your own.\nEager and never weary we pursued\nOur home amusements by the warm peat-fire\nAt evening; when with pencil and with slate,\nIn square divisions parcell'd out, and all\nWith crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,\nWe schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head\nIn strife too humble to be named in Verse.\nOr round the naked table, snow-white deal,\nCherry or maple, sate in close array,\nAnd to the combat, Lu or Whist, led on\nthick-ribbed Army; not as in the world\nNeglected and ungratefully thrown by\nEven for the very service they had wrought,\nBut husbanded through many a long campaign.\nUncouth assemblage was it, where no few\nHad changed their functions, some, plebeian cards,\nWhich Fate beyond the promise of their birth\nHad glorified, and call'd to represent\nThe persons of departed Potentates.\nOh! with what echoes on the Board they fell!\nIronic Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades,\nA congregation piteously akin.\nCheap matter did they give to boyish wit,\nThose sooty knaves, precipitated down\nWith scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of Heaven,\nThe paramount Ace, a moon in her eclipse,\nQueens, gleaming through their splendour's last decay,\nAnd Monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain'd\nBy royal visages. Meanwhile, abroad\nThe heavy rain was falling, or the frost\nRaged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth,\nAnd, interrupting oft the impassion'd game,\nFrom Esthwaite's neighbouring Lake the splitting ice,\nWhile it sank down towards the water, sent,\nAmong the meadows and the hills, its long\nAnd dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves\nWhen they are howling round the Bothnic Main.\n\nNor, sedulous as I have been to trace\nHow Nature by extrinsic passion first\nPeopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand,\nAnd made me love them, may I well forget\nHow other pleasures have been mine, and joys\nOf subtler origin; how I have felt,\nNot seldom, even in that tempestuous time,\nThose hallow'd and pure motions of the sense\nWhich seem, in their simplicity, to own\nAn intellectual charm, that calm delight\nWhich, if I err not, surely must belong\nTo those first-born affinities that fit\nOur new existence to existing things,\nAnd, in our dawn of being, constitute\nThe bond of union betwixt life and joy.\n\nYes, I remember, when the changeful earth,\nAnd twice five seasons on my mind had stamp'd\nThe faces of the moving year, even then,\nA Child, I held unconscious intercourse\nWith the eternal Beauty, drinking in\nA pure organic pleasure from the lines\nOf curling mist, or from the level plain\nOf waters colour'd by the steady clouds.\n\nThe Sands of Westmoreland, the Creeks and Bays\nOf Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell\nHow when the Sea threw off his evening shade\nAnd to the Shepherd's huts beneath the crags\nDid send sweet notice of the rising moon,\nHow I have stood, to fancies such as these,\nEngrafted in the tenderness of thought,\nA stranger, linking with the spectacle\nNo conscious memory of a kindred sight,\nAnd bringing with me no peculiar sense\nOf quietness or peace, yet I have stood,\nEven while mine eye has mov'd o'er three long leagues\nOf shining water, gathering, as it seem'd,\nThrough every hair-breadth of that field of light,\nNew pleasure, like a bee among the flowers.\n\nThus, often in those fits of vulgar joy\nWhich, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits\nAre prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss\nWhich, like a tempest, works along the blood\nAnd is forgotten; even then I felt\nGleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth\nAnd common face of Nature spake to me\nRememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,\nBy chance collisions and quaint accidents\nLike those ill-sorted unions, work suppos'd\nOf evil-minded fairies, yet not vain\nNor profitless, if haply they impress'd\nCollateral objects and appearances,\nAlbeit lifeless then, and doom'd to sleep\nUntil maturer seasons call'd them forth\nTo impregnate and to elevate the mind.\n—And if the vulgar joy by its own weight\nWearied itself out of the memory,\nThe scenes which were a witness of that joy\nRemained, in their substantial lineaments\nDepicted on the brain, and to the eye\nWere visible, a daily sight; and thus\nBy the impressive discipline of fear,\nBy pleasure and repeated happiness,\nSo frequently repeated, and by force\nOf obscure feelings representative\nOf joys that were forgotten, these same scenes,\nSo beauteous and majestic in themselves,\nThough yet the day was distant, did at length\nBecome habitually dear, and all\nTheir hues and forms were by invisible links\nAllied to the affections.\n\nI began\nMy story early, feeling as I fear,\nThe weakness of a human love, for days\nDisown'd by memory, ere the birth of spring\nPlanting my snowdrops among winter snows.\nNor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so prompt\nIn sympathy, that I have lengthen'd out,\nWith fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale.\nMeanwhile, my hope has been that I might fetch\nInvigorating thoughts from former years,\nMight fix the wavering balance of my wind,\nAnd haply meet reproaches, too, whose power\nMay spur me on, in manhood now mature,\nTo honorable toil. Yet should these hopes\nBe vain, and thus should neither I be taught\nTo understand myself, nor thou to know\nWith better knowledge how the heart was fram'd\nOf him thou lovest, need I dread from thee\nHarsh judgments, if I am so loth to quit\nThose recollected hours that have the charm\nOf visionary things, and lovely forms\nAnd sweet sensations that throw back our life\nAnd almost make our Infancy itself\nA visible scene, on which the sun is shining?\n\nOne end hereby at least hath been attain'd,\nMy mind hath been revived, and if this mood\nDesert me not, I will forthwith bring down,\nThrough later years, the story of my life.\nThe road lies plain before me; 'tis a theme\nSingle and of determined bounds; and hence\nI chuse it rather at this time, than work\nOf ampler or more varied argument."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much\nUnvisited, endeavour'd to retrace\nMy life through its first years, and measured back\nThe way I travell'd when I first began\nTo love the woods and fields; the passion yet\nWas in its birth, sustain'd, as might befal,\nBy nourishment that came unsought, for still,\nFrom week to week, from month to month, we liv'd\nA round of tumult: duly were our games\nProlong'd in summer till the day-light fail'd;\nNo chair remain'd before the doors, the bench\nAnd threshold steps were empty; fast asleep\nThe Labourer, and the old Man who had sate,\nA later lingerer, yet the revelry\nContinued, and the loud uproar: at last,\nWhen all the ground was dark, and the huge clouds\nWere edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went,\nWith weary joints, and with a beating mind.\nAh! is there one who ever has been young,\nNor needs a monitory voice to tame\nThe pride of virtue, and of intellect?\nAnd is there one, the wisest and the best\nOf all mankind, who does not sometimes wish\nFor things which cannot be, who would not give,\nIf so he might, to duty and to truth\nThe eagerness of infantine desire?\nA tranquillizing spirit presses now\nOn my corporeal frame: so wide appears\nThe vacancy between me and those days,\nWhich yet have such self-presence in my mind\nThat, sometimes, when I think of them, I seem\nTwo consciousnesses, conscious of myself\nAnd of some other Being. A grey Stone\nOf native rock, left midway in the Square\nOf our small market Village, was the home\nAnd centre of these joys, and when, return'd\nAfter long absence, thither I repair'd,\nI found that it was split, and gone to build\nA smart Assembly-room that perk'd and flar'd\nWith wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground\nWhich had been ours. But let the fiddle scream,\nAnd be ye happy! yet, my Friends! I know\nThat more than one of you will think with me\nOf those soft starry nights, and that old Dame\nFrom whom the stone was nam'd who there had sate\nAnd watch'd her Table with its huckster's wares\nAssiduous, thro' the length of sixty years.\n\nWe ran a boisterous race; the year span round\nWith giddy motion. But the time approach'd\nThat brought with it a regular desire\nFor calmer pleasures, when the beauteous forms\nOf Nature were collaterally attach'd\nTo every scheme of holiday delight,\nAnd every boyish sport, less grateful else,\nAnd languidly pursued.\n\nWhen summer came\nIt was the pastime of our afternoons\nTo beat along the plain of Windermere\nWith rival oars, and the selected bourne\nWas now an Island musical with birds\nThat sang for ever; now a Sister Isle\nBeneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown\nWith lillies of the valley, like a field;\nAnd now a third small Island where remain'd\nAn old stone Table, and a moulder'd Cave,\nA Hermit's history. In such a race,\nSo ended, disappointment could be none,\nUneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:\nWe rested in the shade, all pleas'd alike,\nConquer'd and Conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,\nAnd the vain-glory of superior skill\nWere interfus'd with objects which subdu'd\nAnd temper'd them, and gradually produc'd\nA quiet independence of the heart.\nAnd to my Friend, who knows me, I may add,\nUnapprehensive of reproof, that hence\nEnsu'd a diffidence and modesty,\nAnd I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,\nThe self-sufficing power of solitude.\n\nNo delicate viands sapp'd our bodily strength;\nMore than we wish'd we knew the blessing then\nOf vigorous hunger, for our daily meals\nWere frugal, Sabine fare! and then, exclude\nA little weekly stipend, and we lived\nThrough three divisions of the quarter'd year\nIn pennyless poverty. But now, to School\nReturn'd, from the half-yearly holidays,\nWe came with purses more profusely fill'd,\nAllowance which abundantly suffic'd\nTo gratify the palate with repasts\nMore costly than the Dame of whom I spake,\nThat ancient Woman, and her board supplied.\nHence inroads into distant Vales, and long\nExcursions far away among the hills,\nHence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,\nOr in the woods, or near a river side,\nOr by some shady fountain, while soft airs\nAmong the leaves were stirring, and the sun\nUnfelt, shone sweetly round us in our joy.\n\nNor is my aim neglected, if I tell\nHow twice in the long length of those half-years\nWe from our funds, perhaps, with bolder hand\nDrew largely, anxious for one day, at least,\nTo feel the motion of the galloping Steed;\nAnd with the good old Inn-keeper, in truth,\nOn such occasion sometimes we employ'd\nSly subterfuge; for the intended bound\nOf the day's journey was too distant far\nFor any cautious man, a Structure famed\nBeyond its neighbourhood, the antique Walls\nOf that large Abbey which within the vale\nOf Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built,\nStands yet, a mouldering Pile, with fractured Arch,\nBelfry, and Images, and living Trees,\nA holy Scene! along the smooth green turf\nOur Horses grazed: to more than inland peace\nLeft by the sea wind passing overhead\n(Though wind of roughest temper) trees and towers\nMay in that Valley oftentimes be seen,\nBoth silent and both motionless alike;\nSuch is the shelter that is there, and such\nThe safeguard for repose and quietness.\n\nOur steeds remounted, and the summons given,\nWith whip and spur we by the Chauntry flew\nIn uncouth race, and left the cross-legg'd Knight,\nAnd the stone-Abbot, and that single Wren\nWhich one day sang so sweetly in the Nave\nOf the old Church, that, though from recent showers\nThe earth was comfortless, and, touch'd by faint\nInternal breezes, sobbings of the place,\nAnd respirations, from the roofless walls\nThe shuddering ivy dripp'd large drops, yet still,\nSo sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible Bird\nSang to itself, that there I could have made\nMy dwelling-place, and liv'd for ever there\nTo hear such music. Through the Walls we flew\nAnd down the valley, and a circuit made\nIn wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth\nWe scamper'd homeward. Oh! ye Rocks and Streams,\nAnd that still Spirit of the evening air!\nEven in this joyous time I sometimes felt\nYour presence, when with slacken'd step we breath'd\nAlong the sides of the steep hills, or when,\nLighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea,\nWe beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.\n\nUpon the Eastern Shore of Windermere,\nAbove the crescent of a pleasant Bay,\nThere stood an Inn, no homely-featured Shed,\nBrother of the surrounding Cottages,\nBut 'twas a splendid place, the door beset\nWith Chaises, Grooms, and Liveries, and within\nDecanters, Glasses, and the blood-red Wine.\nIn ancient times, or ere the Hall was built\nOn the large Island, had this Dwelling been\nMore worthy of a Poet's love, a Hut,\nProud of its one bright fire, and sycamore shade.\nBut though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed\nThe threshold, and large golden characters\nOn the blue-frosted Signboard had usurp'd\nThe place of the old Lion, in contempt\nAnd mockery of the rustic painter's hand,\nYet to this hour the spot to me is dear\nWith all its foolish pomp. The garden lay\nUpon a slope surmounted by the plain\nOf a small Bowling-green; beneath us stood\nA grove; with gleams of water through the trees\nAnd over the tree-tops; nor did we want\nRefreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.\nAnd there, through half an afternoon, we play'd\nOn the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent\nMade all the mountains ring. But ere the fall\nOf night, when in our pinnace we return'd\nOver the dusky Lake, and to the beach\nOf some small Island steer'd our course with one,\nThe Minstrel of our troop, and left him there,\nAnd row'd off gently, while he blew his flute\nAlone upon the rock; Oh! then the calm\nAnd dead still water lay upon my mind\nEven with a weight of pleasure, and the sky\nNever before so beautiful, sank down\nInto my heart, and held me like a dream.\n\nThus daily were my sympathies enlarged,\nAnd thus the common range of visible things\nGrew dear to me: already I began\nTo love the sun, a Boy I lov'd the sun,\nNot as I since have lov'd him, as a pledge\nAnd surety of our earthly life, a light\nWhich while we view we feel we are alive;\nBut, for this cause, that I had seen him lay\nHis beauty on the morning hills, had seen\nThe western mountain touch his setting orb,\nIn many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess\nOf happiness, my blood appear'd to flow\nWith its own pleasure, and I breath'd with joy.\nAnd from like feelings, humble though intense,\nTo patriotic and domestic love\nAnalogous, the moon to me was dear;\nFor I would dream away my purposes,\nStanding to look upon her while she hung\nMidway between the hills, as if she knew\nNo other region; but belong'd to thee,\nYea, appertain'd by a peculiar right\nTo thee and thy grey huts, my darling Vale!\n\nThose incidental charms which first attach'd\nMy heart to rural objects, day by day\nGrew weaker, and I hasten on to tell\nHow Nature, intervenient till this time,\nAnd secondary, now at length was sought\nFor her own sake. But who shall parcel out\nHis intellect, by geometric rules,\nSplit, like a province, into round and square?\nWho knows the individual hour in which\nHis habits were first sown, even as a seed,\nWho that shall point, as with a wand, and say,\n'This portion of the river of my mind\nCame from yon fountain?' Thou, my Friend! art one\nMore deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee\nScience appears but, what in truth she is,\nNot as our glory and our absolute boast,\nBut as a succedaneum, and a prop\nTo our infirmity. Thou art no slave\nOf that false secondary power, by which,\nIn weakness, we create distinctions, then\nDeem that our puny boundaries are things\nWhich we perceive, and not which we have made.\nTo thee, unblinded by these outward shows,\nThe unity of all has been reveal'd\nAnd thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skill'd\nThan many are to class the cabinet\nOf their sensations, and, in voluble phrase,\nRun through the history and birth of each,\nAs of a single independent thing.\nHard task to analyse a soul, in which,\nNot only general habits and desires,\nBut each most obvious and particular thought,\nNot in a mystical and idle sense,\nBut in the words of reason deeply weigh'd,\nHath no beginning.\n\nBless'd the infant Babe,\n(For with my best conjectures I would trace\nThe progress of our Being) blest the Babe,\nNurs'd in his Mother's arms, the Babe who sleeps\nUpon his Mother's breast, who, when his soul\nClaims manifest kindred with an earthly soul,\nDoth gather passion from his Mother's eye!\nSuch feelings pass into his torpid life\nLike an awakening breeze, and hence his mind\nEven [in the first trial of its powers]\nIs prompt and watchful, eager to combine\nIn one appearance, all the elements\nAnd parts of the same object, else detach'd\nAnd loth to coalesce. Thus, day by day,\nSubjected to the discipline of love,\nHis organs and recipient faculties\nAre quicken'd, are more vigorous, his mind spreads,\nTenacious of the forms which it receives.\nIn one beloved presence, nay and more,\nIn that most apprehensive habitude\nAnd those sensations which have been deriv'd\nFrom this beloved Presence, there exists\nA virtue which irradiates and exalts\nAll objects through all intercourse of sense.\nNo outcast he, bewilder'd and depress'd;\nAlong his infant veins are interfus'd\nThe gravitation and the filial bond\nOf nature, that connect him with the world.\nEmphatically such a Being lives,\nAn inmate of this active universe;\nFrom nature largely he receives; nor so\nIs satisfied, but largely gives again,\nFor feeling has to him imparted strength,\nAnd powerful in all sentiments of grief,\nOf exultation, fear, and joy, his mind,\nEven as an agent of the one great mind,\nCreates, creator and receiver both,\nWorking but in alliance with the works\nWhich it beholds.—Such, verily, is the first\nPoetic spirit of our human life;\nBy uniform control of after years\nIn most abated or suppress'd, in some,\nThrough every change of growth or of decay,\nPre-eminent till death.\n\nFrom early days,\nBeginning not long after that first time\nIn which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch,\nI held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart\nI have endeavour'd to display the means\nWhereby this infant sensibility,\nGreat birthright of our Being, was in me\nAugmented and sustain'd. Yet is a path\nMore difficult before me, and I fear\nThat in its broken windings we shall need\nThe chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:\nFor now a trouble came into my mind\nFrom unknown causes. I was left alone,\nSeeking the visible world, nor knowing why.\nThe props of my affections were remov'd,\nAnd yet the building stood, as if sustain'd\nBy its own spirit! All that I beheld\nWas dear to me, and from this cause it came,\nThat now to Nature's finer influxes\nMy mind lay open, to that more exact\nAnd intimate communion which our hearts\nMaintain with the minuter properties\nOf objects which already are belov'd,\nAnd of those only. Many are the joys\nOf youth; but oh! what happiness to live\nWhen every hour brings palpable access\nOf knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,\nAnd sorrow is not there. The seasons came,\nAnd every season to my notice brought\nA store of transitory qualities\nWhich, but for this most watchful power of love\nHad been neglected, left a register\nOf permanent relations, else unknown,\nHence life, and change, and beauty, solitude\nMore active, even, than 'best society',\nSociety made sweet as solitude\nBy silent inobtrusive sympathies,\nAnd gentle agitations of the mind\nFrom manifold distinctions, difference\nPerceived in things, where to the common eye,\nNo difference is; and hence, from the same source\nSublimer joy; for I would walk alone,\nIn storm and tempest, or in starlight nights\nBeneath the quiet Heavens; and, at that time,\nHave felt whate'er there is of power in sound\nTo breathe an elevated mood, by form\nOr image unprofaned; and I would stand,\nBeneath some rock, listening to sounds that are\nThe ghostly language of the ancient earth,\nOr make their dim abode in distant winds.\nThence did I drink the visionary power.\nI deem not profitless those fleeting moods\nOf shadowy exultation: not for this,\nThat they are kindred to our purer mind\nAnd intellectual life; but that the soul,\nRemembering how she felt, but what she felt\nRemembering not, retains an obscure sense\nOf possible sublimity, to which,\nWith growing faculties she doth aspire,\nWith faculties still growing, feeling still\nThat whatsoever point they gain, they still\nHave something to pursue.\n\nAnd not alone,\nIn grandeur and in tumult, but no less\nIn tranquil scenes, that universal power\nAnd fitness in the latent qualities\nAnd essences of things, by which the mind\nIs mov'd by feelings of delight, to me\nCame strengthen'd with a superadded soul,\nA virtue not its own. My morning walks\nWere early; oft, before the hours of School\nI travell'd round our little Lake, five miles\nOf pleasant wandering, happy time! more dear\nFor this, that one was by my side, a Friend\nThen passionately lov'd; with heart how full\nWill he peruse these lines, this page, perhaps\nA blank to other men! for many years\nHave since flow'd in between us; and our minds,\nBoth silent to each other, at this time\nWe live as if those hours had never been.\nNor seldom did I lift our cottage latch\nFar earlier, and before the vernal thrush\nWas audible, among the hills I sate\nAlone, upon some jutting eminence\nAt the first hour of morning, when the Vale\nLay quiet in an utter solitude.\nHow shall I trace the history, where seek\nThe origin of what I then have felt?\nOft in these moments such a holy calm\nDid overspread my soul, that I forgot\nThat I had bodily eyes, and what I saw\nAppear'd like something in myself, a dream,\nA prospect in my mind.\n\n'Twere long to tell\nWhat spring and autumn, what the winter snows,\nAnd what the summer shade, what day and night,\nThe evening and the morning, what my dreams\nAnd what my waking thoughts supplied, to nurse\nThat spirit of religious love in which\nI walked with Nature. But let this, at least\nBe not forgotten, that I still retain'd\nMy first creative sensibility,\nThat by the regular action of the world\nMy soul was unsubdu'd. A plastic power\nAbode with me, a forming hand, at times\nRebellious, acting in a devious mood,\nA local spirit of its own, at war\nWith general tendency, but for the most\nSubservient strictly to the external things\nWith which it commun'd. An auxiliar light\nCame from my mind which on the setting sun\nBestow'd new splendor, the melodious birds,\nThe gentle breezes, fountains that ran on,\nMurmuring so sweetly in themselves, obey'd\nA like dominion; and the midnight storm\nGrew darker in the presence of my eye.\nHence by obeisance, my devotion hence,\nAnd hence my transport.\n\nNor should this, perchance,\nPass unrecorded, that I still have lov'd\nThe exercise and produce of a toil\nThan analytic industry to me\nMore pleasing, and whose character I deem\nIs more poetic as resembling more\nCreative agency. I mean to speak\nOf that interminable building rear'd\nBy observation of affinities\nIn objects where no brotherhood exists\nTo common minds. My seventeenth year was come\nAnd, whether from this habit, rooted now\nSo deeply in my mind, or from excess\nOf the great social principle of life,\nCoercing all things into sympathy,\nTo unorganic natures I transferr'd\nMy own enjoyments, or, the power of truth\nComing in revelation, I convers'd\nWith things that really are, I, at this time\nSaw blessings spread around me like a sea.\nThus did my days pass on, and now at length\nFrom Nature and her overflowing soul\nI had receiv'd so much that all my thoughts\nWere steep'd in feeling; I was only then\nContented when with bliss ineffable\nI felt the sentiment of Being spread\nO'er all that moves, and all that seemeth still,\nO'er all, that, lost beyond the reach of thought\nAnd human knowledge, to the human eye\nInvisible, yet liveth to the heart,\nO'er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings,\nOr beats the gladsome air, o'er all that glides\nBeneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself\nAnd mighty depth of waters. Wonder not\nIf such my transports were; for in all things\nI saw one life, and felt that it was joy.\nOne song they sang, and it was audible,\nMost audible then when the fleshly ear,\nO'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain,\nForgot its functions, and slept undisturb'd.\n\nIf this be error, and another faith\nFind easier access to the pious mind,\nYet were I grossly destitute of all\nThose human sentiments which make this earth\nSo dear, if I should fail, with grateful voice\nTo speak of you, Ye Mountains and Ye Lakes,\nAnd sounding Cataracts! Ye Mists and Winds\nThat dwell among the hills where I was born.\nIf, in my youth, I have been pure in heart,\nIf, mingling with the world, I am content\nWith my own modest pleasures, and have liv'd,\nWith God and Nature communing, remov'd\nFrom little enmities and low desires,\nThe gift is yours; if in these times of fear,\nThis melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown,\nIf, 'mid indifference and apathy\nAnd wicked exultation, when good men,\nOn every side fall off we know not how,\nTo selfishness, disguis'd in gentle names\nOf peace, and quiet, and domestic love,\nYet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers\nOn visionary minds; if in this time\nOf dereliction and dismay, I yet\nDespair not of our nature; but retain\nA more than Roman confidence, a faith\nThat fails not, in all sorrow my support,\nThe blessing of my life, the gift is yours,\nYe mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed\nMy lofty speculations; and in thee,\nFor this uneasy heart of ours I find\nA never-failing principle of joy,\nAnd purest passion.\n\nThou, my Friend! wert rear'd\nIn the great City, 'mid far other scenes;\nBut we, by different roads at length have gain'd\nThe self-same bourne. And for this cause to Thee\nI speak, unapprehensive of contempt,\nThe insinuated scoff of coward tongues,\nAnd all that silent language which so oft\nIn conversation betwixt man and man\nBlots from the human countenance all trace\nOf beauty and of love. For Thou hast sought\nThe truth in solitude, and Thou art one,\nThe most intense of Nature's worshippers\nIn many things my Brother, chiefly here\nIn this my deep devotion.\n\nFare Thee well!\nHealth, and the quiet of a healthful mind\nAttend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,\nAnd yet more often living with Thyself,\nAnd for Thyself, so haply shall thy days\nBe many, and a blessing to mankind."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting,still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!"}

nor word from word could I divide;\nAnd the whole body of the Man did seem\nLike one whom I had met with in a dream;\nOr like a man from some far region sent,\nTo give me human strength, by apt admonishment.\n\nMy former thoughts returned: the fear that kills;\nAnd hope that is unwilling to be fed;\nCold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;\nAnd mighty Poets in their misery dead.\n—Perplexed, and longing to be comforted,\nMy question eagerly did I renew,\n\"How is it that you live, and what is it you do?\"\n\nHe with a smile did then his words repeat;\nAnd said that, gathering leeches, far and wide\nHe travelled; stirring thus about his feet\nThe waters of the pools where they abide.\n\"Once I could meet with them on every side;\nBut they have dwindled long by slow decay;\nYet still I persevere, and find them where I may.\"\n\nWhile he was talking thus, the lonely place,\nThe old Man's shape, and speech—all troubled me:\nIn my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace\nAbout the weary moors continually,\nWandering about alone and silently.\nWhile I these thoughts within myself pursued,\nHe, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed.\n\nAnd soon with this he other matter blended,\nCheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,\nBut stately in the main; and, when he ended,\nI could have laughed myself to scorn to find\nIn that decrepit Man so firm a mind.\n\"God,\" said I, \"be my help and stay secure;\nI'll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!\""}

of the shod horses on the granite floor,\nThe snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,\nThe hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous’d mobs,\nThe flap of the curtain’d litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,\nThe meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,\nThe excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd,\nThe impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,\nWhat groans of over-fed or half-starv’d who fall sunstruck or in fits,\nWhat exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes,\nWhat living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain’d by decorum,\nArrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips,\nI mind them or the show or resonance of them—I come and I depart.\n\n9\n\nThe big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\nThe dried grass of the harvest-time loads the

mountains I hunt,\nWandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,\nIn the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\nKindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill’d game,\nFalling asleep on

to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,\nOn a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,\nShe had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach’d to her feet.\n\nThe runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\nI heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\nThrough the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\nAnd went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\nAnd brought water and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d feet,\nAnd gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,\nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\nAnd remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass’d north,\nI had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean’d in the corner.\n\n11\n\nTwenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\nTwenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\nTwenty-eight years of womanly life and all so

them is beautiful to her.\n\nWhere are you off to, lady? for I see you,\nYou splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\n\nDancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,\nThe rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\n\nThe beards of the young men glisten’d with wet, it ran from their long hair,\nLittle streams pass’d all over their bodies.\n\nAn unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies,\nIt descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\n\nThe young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,\nThey do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,\nThey do not think whom they souse with spray.\n\n12\n\nThe butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market,\nI loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\n\nBlacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,\nEach has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in the fire.\n\nFrom the cinder-strew’d threshold I follow their movements,\nThe lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,\nOverhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,\nThey do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\n\n13\n\nThe negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain,\nThe negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands pois’d on one leg on the string-piece,\nHis blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip-band,\nHis glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead,\nThe sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of his polish’d and perfect limbs.\n\nI behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,\nI go with the team also.\n\nIn me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as forward sluing,\nTo niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,\nAbsorbing all to myself and for this song.\n\nOxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your eyes?\nIt seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\n\nMy tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and day-long ramble,\nThey rise together, they slowly circle around.\n\nI believe in those wing’d purposes,\nAnd acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\nAnd consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,\nAnd do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,\nAnd the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,\nAnd the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\n\n14\n\nThe wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,\nYa-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,\nThe pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,\nFind its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\n\nThe sharp-hoof’d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog,\nThe litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\nThe brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,\nI see in them and myself the same old law.\n\nThe press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,\nThey scorn the best I can do to relate them.\n\nI am enamour’d of growing out-doors,\nOf men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,\nOf the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses,\nI can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\n\nWhat is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\nMe going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\nAdorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,\nNot asking the sky to come down to my good will,\nScattering it freely forever.\n\n15\n\nThe pure contralto sings in the organ loft,\nThe

Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the factory or mill,\nThe paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter’s lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering with blue and gold,\nThe canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,\nThe conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him,\nThe child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,\nThe regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white sails sparkle!)\nThe drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,\nThe pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the odd cent;)\nThe bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly,\nThe opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open’d lips,\nThe prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck,\nThe crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other,\n(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)\nThe President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great Secretaries,\nOn the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms,\nThe crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold,\nThe Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,\nAs the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling of loose change,\nThe floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for mortar,\nIn single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;\nSeasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather’d, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small arms!)\nSeasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;\nOff on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface,\nThe stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe,\nFlatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees,\nCoon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through those drain’d by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,\nTorches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw,\n\nPatriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around them,\nIn walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day’s sport,\nThe city sleeps and the country sleeps,\nThe living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,\nThe old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife;\nAnd these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,\nAnd such as it is to be of these more or less I am,\nAnd of these one and all I weave the song of myself.\n\n16\n\nI am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,\nRegardless of others, ever regardful of others,\nMaternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,\nStuff’d with the stuff that is coarse and stuff’d with the stuff that is fine,\nOne of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same,\nA Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the Oconee I live,\nA Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,\nA Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,\nA boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;\nAt home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland,\nAt home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking,\nAt home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan ranch,\nComrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners, (loving their big proportions,)\nComrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat,\nA learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,\nA novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,\nOf every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,\nA farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,\nPrisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.\n\nI resist any thing better than my own diversity,\nBreathe the air but leave plenty after me,\nAnd am not stuck up, and am in my place.\n\n(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,\nThe bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place,\nThe palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)\n\n17\n\nThese are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me,\nIf they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing,\nIf they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,\nIf they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.\n\nThis is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,\nThis the common air that bathes the globe.\n\n18\n\nWith music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,\nI play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for conquer’d and slain persons.\n\nHave you heard that it was good to gain the day?\nI also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.\n\nI beat and pound for the dead,\nI blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.\n\nVivas to those who have fail’d!\nAnd to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!\nAnd to those themselves who sank in the sea!\nAnd to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!\nAnd the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!\n\n19\n\nThis is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,\nIt is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make appointments with all,\nI will not have a single person slighted or left away,\nThe kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,\nThe heavy-lipp’d slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;\nThere shall be no difference between them and the rest.\n\nThis is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,\nThis the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,\nThis the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,\nThis the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.\n\nDo you guess I have some intricate purpose?\nWell I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has.\n\nDo you take it I would astonish?\nDoes the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering through the woods?\nDo I astonish more than they?\n\nThis hour I tell things in confidence,\nI might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.\n\n20\n\nWho goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;\nHow is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?\n\nWhat is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?\n\nAll I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,\nElse it were time lost listening to me.\n\nI do not snivel that snivel the world over,\nThat months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.\n\nWhimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity goes to the fourth-remov’d,\nI wear my hat as I please indoors or out.\n\nWhy should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?\n\nHaving pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel’d with doctors and calculated close,\nI find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.\n\nIn all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,\nAnd the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.\n\nI know I am solid and sound,\nTo me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,\nAll are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.\n\nI know I am deathless,\nI know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter’s compass,\nI know I shall not pass like a child’s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.\n\nI know I am august,\nI do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,\nI see that the elementary laws never apologize,\n(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.)\n\nI exist as I am, that is enough,\nIf no other in the world be aware I sit content,\nAnd if each and all be aware I sit content.\n\nOne world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,\nAnd whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years,\nI can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.\n\nMy foothold is tenon’d and mortis’d in granite,\nI laugh at what you call dissolution,\nAnd I know the amplitude of time.\n\n21\n\nI am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,\nThe pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,\nThe first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a new tongue.\n\nI am the poet of the woman the same as the man,\nAnd I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,\nAnd I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.\n\nI chant the chant of dilation or pride,\nWe have had ducking and deprecating about enough,\nI show that size is only development.\n\nHave you outstript the rest? are you the President?\nIt is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.\n\nI am he that walks with the tender and growing night,\nI call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.\n\nPress close bare-bosom’d night—press close magnetic nourishing night!\nNight of south winds—night of the large few stars!\nStill nodding night—mad naked summer night.\n\nSmile O voluptuous cool-breath’d earth!\nEarth of the slumbering and liquid trees!\nEarth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains misty-topt!\nEarth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!\nEarth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!\nEarth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!\nFar-swooping elbow’d earth—rich apple-blossom’d earth!\nSmile, for your lover comes.\n\nProdigal, you have given me love—therefore I to you give love!\nO unspeakable passionate love.\n\n22\n\nYou sea! I resign myself to you also—I guess what you mean,\nI behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,\nI believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,\nWe must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the land,\nCushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,\nDash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.\n\nSea of stretch’d ground-swells,\nSea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,\nSea of the brine of life and of unshovell’d yet always-ready graves,\nHowler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,\nI am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.\n\nPartaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation,\nExtoller of amies and those that sleep in each others’ arms.\n\nI am he attesting sympathy,\n(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them?)\n\nI am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.\n\nWhat blurt is this about virtue and about vice?\nEvil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,\nMy gait is no fault-finder’s or rejecter’s gait,\nI moisten the roots of all that has grown.\n\nDid you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?\nDid you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work’d over and rectified?\n\nI find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,\nSoft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,\nThoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.\n\nThis minute that comes to me over the past decillions,\nThere is no better than it and now.\n\nWhat behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such a wonder,\nThe wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.\n\n23\n\nEndless unfolding of words of ages!\nAnd mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.\n\nA word of the faith that never balks,\nHere or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time absolutely.\n\nIt alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,\nThat mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.\n\nI accept Reality and dare not question it,\nMaterialism first and last imbuing.\n\nHurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!\nFetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,\nThis is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of the old cartouches,\nThese mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.\nThis is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a mathematician.\n\nGentlemen, to you the first honors always!\nYour facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,\nI but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.\n\nLess the reminders of properties told my words,\nAnd more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,\nAnd make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt,\nAnd beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.\n\n24\n\nWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,\nTurbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,\nNo sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,\nNo more modest than immodest.\n\nUnscrew the locks from the doors!\nUnscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!\n\nWhoever degrades another degrades me,\nAnd whatever is done or said returns at last to me.\n\nThrough me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current and index.\n\nI speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,\nBy God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.\n\nThrough me many long dumb voices,\nVoices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,\nVoices of the diseas’d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,\nVoices of cycles of preparation and accretion,\nAnd of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,\nAnd of the rights of them the others are down upon,\nOf the deform’d, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,\nFog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.\n\nThrough me forbidden voices,\nVoices of sexes and lusts, voices veil’d and I remove the veil,\nVoices indecent by me clarified and transfigur’d.\n\nI do not press my fingers across my mouth,\nI keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,\nCopulation is no more rank to me than death is.\n\nI believe in the flesh and the appetites,\nSeeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.\n\nDivine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch’d from,\nThe scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,\nThis head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.\n\nIf I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,\nTranslucent mould of me it shall be you!\nShaded ledges and rests it shall be you!\nFirm masculine colter it shall be you!\nWhatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!\nYou my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!\nBreast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!\nMy brain it shall be your occult convolutions!\nRoot of wash’d sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!\nMix’d tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!\nTrickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!\nSun so generous it shall be you!\nVapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!\nYou sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!\nWinds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!\nBroad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!\nHands I have taken, face I have kiss’d, mortal I have ever touch’d, it shall be you.\n\nI dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,\nEach moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,\nI cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,\nNor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take again.\n\nThat I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,\nA morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.\n\nTo behold the day-break!\nThe little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,\nThe air tastes good to my palate.\n\nHefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding,\nScooting obliquely high and low.\n\nSomething I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,\nSeas of bright juice suffuse heaven.\n\nThe earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,\nThe heav’d challenge from the east that moment over my head,\nThe mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!\n\n25\n\nDazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,\nIf I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\n\nWe also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,\nWe found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.\n\nMy voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,\nWith the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.\n\nSpeech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,\nIt provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,\nWalt you contain enough, why don’t you let it out then?\n\nCome now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation,\nDo you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?\nWaiting in gloom, protected by frost,\nThe dirt receding before my prophetical screams,\nI underlying causes to balance them at last,\nMy knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,\nHappiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day.)\n\nMy final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,\nEncompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,\nI crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.\n\nWriting and talk do not prove me,\nI carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,\nWith the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\n\n26\n\nNow I will do nothing but listen,\nTo accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.\n\nI hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals,\nI hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,\nI hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,\nSounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,\nTalkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals,\nThe angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,\nThe judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence,\nThe heave’e’yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters,\nThe ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color’d lights,\nThe steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,\nThe slow march play’d at the head of the association marching two and two,\n(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)\n\nI hear the violoncello, (’tis the young man’s heart’s complaint,)\nI hear the key’d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,\nIt shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\n\nI hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,\nAh this indeed is music—this suits me.\n\nA tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,\nThe orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\n\nI hear the train’d soprano (what work with hers is this?)\nThe orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,\nIt wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess’d them,\nIt sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick’d by the indolent waves,\nI am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,\nSteep’d amid honey’d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,\n\nAt length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\nAnd that we call Being.\n\n27\n\nTo be in any form, what is that?\n(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)\nIf nothing lay more develop’d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.\n\nMine is no callous shell,\nI have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,\nThey seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\n\nI merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,\nTo touch my person to some one else’s is about as much as I can stand.\n\n28\n\nIs this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\nFlames and ether making a rush for my veins,\nTreacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\nMy flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself,\nOn all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\nStraining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\nBehaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\nDepriving me of my best as for a purpose,\nUnbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\nDeluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,\nImmodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\nThey bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,\nNo consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,\nFetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\nThen all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\n\nThe sentries desert every other part of me,\nThey have left me helpless to a red marauder,\nThey all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.\n\nI am given up by traitors,\nI talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the greatest traitor,\nI went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.\n\nYou villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,\nUnclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.\n\n29\n\nBlind loving wrestling touch, sheath’d hooded sharp-tooth’d touch!\nDid it make you ache so, leaving me?\n\nParting track’d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,\nRich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\n\nSprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,\nLandscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.\n\n30\n\nAll truths wait in all things,\nThey neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,\nThey do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,\nThe insignificant is as big to me as any,\n(What is less or more than a touch?)\n\nLogic and sermons never convince,\nThe damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\n\n(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,\nOnly what nobody denies is so.)\n\nA minute and a drop of me settle my brain,\nI believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\nAnd a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\nAnd a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,\nAnd they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific,\nAnd until one and all shall delight us, and we them.\n\n31\n\nI believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,\nAnd the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,\nAnd the tree-toad is a chef-d’œuvre for the highest,\nAnd the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\nAnd the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\nAnd the cow crunching with depress’d head surpasses any statue,\nAnd a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.\n\nI find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots,\nAnd am stucco’d with quadrupeds and birds all over,\nAnd have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\nBut call any thing back again when I desire it.\n\nIn vain the speeding or shyness,\nIn vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,\nIn vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder’d bones,\nIn vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,\nIn vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,\nIn vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,\nIn vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,\nIn vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,\nIn vain the razor-bill’d auk sails far north to Labrador,\nI follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.\n\n32\n\nI think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain’d,\nI stand and look at them long and long.\n\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition,\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\nThey do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\n\nSo they show their relations to me and I accept them,\nThey bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.\n\nI wonder where they get those tokens,\nDid I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?\n\nMyself moving forward then and now and forever,\nGathering and showing more always and with velocity,\nInfinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,\nNot too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,\nPicking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.\n\nA gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,\nHead high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\nLimbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\nEyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.\n\nHis nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,\nHis well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.\n\nI but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,\nWhy do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?\nEven as I stand or sit passing faster than you.\n\n33\n\nSpace and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess’d at,\nWhat I guess’d when I loaf’d on the grass,\nWhat I guess’d while I lay alone in my bed,\nAnd again as I walk’d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.\n\nMy ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,\nI skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,\nI am afoot with my vision.\n\nBy the city’s quadrangular houses—in log huts, camping with lumbermen,\nAlong the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,\nWeeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,\nProspecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,\nScorch’d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river,\nWhere the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the hunter,\nWhere the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish,\nWhere the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,\nWhere the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;\nOver the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower’d cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field,\nOver the sharp-peak’d farm house, with its scallop’d scum and slender shoots from the gutters,\nOver the western persimmon, over the long-leav’d corn, over the delicate blue-flower flax,\nOver the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest,\nOver the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;\nScaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs,\nWalking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,\nWhere the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,\nWhere the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the dark,\nWhere the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,\nWhere cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,\nWhere the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;\nWhere trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,\nWherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,\nWhere the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself and looking composedly down,)\nWhere the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,\nWhere the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,\nWhere the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,\nWhere the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,\nWhere the half-burn’d brig is riding on unknown currents,\nWhere shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;\nWhere the dense-starr’d flag is borne at the head of the regiments,\nApproaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,\nUnder Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,\nUpon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,\nUpon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base-ball,\nAt he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter,\nAt the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw,\nAt apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,\nAt musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;\nWhere the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps,\nWhere the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scatter’d, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,\nWhere the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,\nWhere the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,\nWhere sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,\nWhere herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near,\nWhere the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding,\nWhere the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh,\nWhere bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds,\nWhere band-neck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out,\nWhere burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery,\nWhere winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,\nWhere the yellow-crown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,\nWhere the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,\nWhere the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well,\nThrough patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,\nThrough the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,\nThrough the gymnasium, through the curtain’d saloon, through the office or public hall;\nPleas’d with the native and pleas’d with the foreign, pleas’d with the new and old,\nPleas’d with the homely woman as well as the handsome,\nPleas’d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,\nPleas’d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash’d church,\nPleas’d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, impress’d seriously at the camp-meeting;\nLooking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turn’d up to the clouds, or down a lane or along the beach,\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheek’d bush-boy, (behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)\nFar from the settlements studying the print of animals’ feet, or the moccasin print,\nBy the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,\nNigh the coffin’d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;\nVoyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\nHurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,\nWalking the old hills of Judæa with the beautiful gentle God by my side,\nSpeeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles,\nSpeeding with tail’d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing,\nI tread day and night such roads.\n\nI visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\nAnd look at quintillions ripen’d and look at quintillions green.\n\nI fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\n\nI help myself to material and immaterial,\nNo guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\n\nI anchor my ship for a little while only,\nMy messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.\n\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\n\nI ascend to the foretruck,\nI take my place late at night in the crow’s-nest,\nWe sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is plain in all directions,\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies toward them,\nWe are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged,\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution,\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city,\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.\n\nI am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\nI turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\n\nMy voice is the wife’s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\nThey fetch my man’s body up dripping and drown’d.\n\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\nThe courage of present times and all times,\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\nHow he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,\nAnd chalk’d in large letters on a board,Be of good cheer, we will not desert you;\nHow he follow’d with them and tack’d with them three days and would not give it up,\nHow he saved the drifting company at last,\nHow the lank loose-gown’d women look’d when boated from the side of their prepared graves,\nHow the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp’d unshaved men;\nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\nI am the man, I suffer’d, I was there.\n\nThe disdain and calmness of martyrs,\nThe mother of old, condemn’d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on,\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover’d with sweat,\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the bullets,\nAll these I feel or am.\n\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn’d with the ooze of my skin,\nI fall on the weeds and stones,\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\nTaunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\n\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments,\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the wounded person,\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\n\nI am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken,\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris,\nHeat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\nThey have clear’d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\n\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,\nPainless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their fire-caps,\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\n\nDistant and dead resuscitate,\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\n\nI am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort’s bombardment,\nI am there again.\n\nAgain the long roll of the drummers,\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars,\nAgain to my listening ears the cannon responsive.\n\nI take part, I see and hear the whole,\nThe cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim’d shots,\nThe ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\n\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand,\nHe gasps through the clot Mind not me—mind—the entrenchments.\n\n34\n\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\n’Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.\n\nRetreating they had form’d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks,\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy’s, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance,\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv’d writing and seal, gave up their arms and march’d back prisoners of war.\n\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers,\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\n\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\nThe work commenced about five o’clock and was over by eight.\n\nNone obey’d the command to kneel,\nSome made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together,\nThe maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,\nSome half-kill’d attempted to crawl away,\nThese were despatch’d with bayonets or batter’d with the blunts of muskets,\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to release him,\nThe three were all torn and cover’d with the boy’s blood.\n\nAt eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies;\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\n\n35\n\nWould you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\nList to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me.\n\nOur foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\nHis was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;\nAlong the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us.\n\nWe closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d,\nMy captain lash’d fast with his own hands.\n\nWe had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water,\nOn our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.\n\nFighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\nTen o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,\nThe master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.\n\nThe transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\nThey see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\n\nOur frigate takes fire,\nThe other asks if we demand quarter?\nIf our colors are struck and the fighting done?\n\nNow I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\nWe have not struck, he composedly cries,we have just begun our part of the fighting.\n\nOnly three guns are in use,\nOne is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s mainmast,\nTwo well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.\n\nThe tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,\nThey hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\n\nNot a moment’s cease,\nThe leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\n\nOne of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\n\nSerene stands the little captain,\nHe is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\n\nToward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\n\n36\n\nStretch’d and still lies the midnight,\nTwo great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\nOur vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer’d,\nThe captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet,\nNear by the corpse of the child that serv’d in the cabin,\nThe dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl’d whiskers,\nThe flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,\nThe husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\nFormless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,\nCut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\nBlack and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\nA few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\nDelicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\nThe hiss of the surgeon’s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\nWheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan,\nThese so, these irretrievable.\n\n37\n\nYou laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\nIn at the conquer’d doors they crowd! I am possess’d!\nEmbody all presences outlaw’d or suffering,\nSee myself in prison shaped like another man,\nAnd feel the dull unintermitted pain.\n\nFor me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,\nIt is I let out in the morning and barr’d at night.\n\nNot a mutineer walks handcuff’d to jail but I am handcuff’d to him and walk by his side,\n(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips.)\n\nNot a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried and sentenced.\n\nNot a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,\nMy face is ash-color’d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.\n\nAskers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,\nI project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\n\n38\n\nEnough! enough! enough!\nSomehow I have been stunn’d. Stand back!\nGive me a little time beyond my cuff’d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,\nI discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.\n\nThat I could forget the mockers and insults!\nThat I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers!\nThat I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning.\n\nI remember now,\nI resume the overstaid fraction,\nThe grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,\nCorpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\n\nI troop forth replenish’d with supreme power, one of an average unending procession,\nInland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\nOur swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\nThe blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.\n\nEleves, I salute you! come forward!\nContinue your annotations, continue your questionings.\n\n39\n\nThe friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\nIs he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\n\nIs he some Southwesterner rais’d out-doors? is he Kanadian?\nIs he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?\nThe mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?\n\nWherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,\nThey desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them.\n\nBehavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb’d head, laughter, and naiveté,\nSlow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations,\nThey descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,\nThey are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of the glance of his eyes.\n\n40\n\nFlaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask—lie over!\nYou light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.\n\nEarth! you seem to look for something at my hands,\nSay, old top-knot, what do you want?\n\nMan or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,\nAnd might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,\nAnd might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and days.\n\nBehold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,\nWhen I give I give myself.\n\nYou there, impotent, loose in the knees,\nOpen your scarf’d chops till I blow grit within you,\nSpread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,\nI am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,\nAnd any thing I have I bestow.\n\nI do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,\nYou can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.\n\nTo cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,\nOn his right cheek I put the family kiss,\nAnd in my soul I swear I never will deny him.\n\nOn women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes.\n(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)\n\nTo any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door.\nTurn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,\nLet the physician and the priest go home.\n\nI seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,\nO despairer, here is my neck,\nBy God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.\n\nI dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,\nEvery room of the house do I fill with an arm’d force,\nLovers of me, bafflers of graves.\n\nSleep—I and they keep guard all night,\nNot doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,\nI have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,\nAnd when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.\n\n41\n\nI am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,\nAnd for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.\n\nI heard what was said of the universe,\nHeard it and heard it of several thousand years;\nIt is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all?\n\nMagnifying and applying come I,\nOutbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,\nTaking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,\nLithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,\nBuying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,\nIn my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved,\nWith Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and image,\nTaking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,\nAdmitting they were alive and did the work of their days,\n(They bore mites as for unfledg’d birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves,)\nAccepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself, bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,\nDiscovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,\nPutting higher claims for him there with his roll’d-up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel,\nNot objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation,\nLads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars,\nMinding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,\nTheir brawny limbs passing safe over charr’d laths, their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;\nBy the mechanic’s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born,\nThree scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg’d out at their waists,\nThe snag-tooth’d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come,\nSelling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;\nWhat was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod then,\nThe bull and the bug never worshipp’d half enough,\nDung and dirt more admirable than was dream’d,\nThe supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes,\nThe day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best, and be as prodigious;\nBy my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,\nPutting myself here and now to the ambush’d womb of the shadows.\n\n42\n\nA call in the midst of the crowd,\nMy own voice, orotund sweeping and final.\n\nCome my children,\nCome my boys and girls, my women, household and intimates,\nNow the performer launches his nerve, he has pass’d his prelude on the reeds within.\n\nEasily written loose-finger’d chords—I feel the thrum of your climax and close.\n\nMy head slues round on my neck,\nMusic rolls, but not from the organ,\nFolks are around me, but they are no household of mine.\n\nEver the hard unsunk ground,\nEver the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,\nEver myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,\nEver the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn’d thumb, that breath of itches and thirsts,\nEver the vexer’s hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth,\nEver love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,\nEver the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.\n\nHere and there with dimes on the eyes walking,\nTo feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,\nTickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going,\nMany sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving,\nA few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.\n\nThis is the city and I am one of the citizens,\nWhatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets, newspapers, schools,\nThe mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.\n\nThe little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail’d coats,\nI am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or fleas,)\nI acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me,\nWhat I do and say the same waits for them,\nEvery thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.\n\nI know perfectly well my own egotism,\nKnow my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,\nAnd would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.\n\nNot words of routine this song of mine,\nBut abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;\nThis printed and bound book—but the printer and the printing-office boy?\nThe well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms?\nThe black ship mail’d with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets—but the pluck of the captain and engineers?\nIn the houses the dishes and fare and furniture—but the host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes?\nThe sky up there—yet here or next door, or across the way?\nThe saints and sages in history—but you yourself?\nSermons, creeds, theology—but the fathomless human brain,\nAnd what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?\n\n43\n\nI do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,\nMy faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,\nEnclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern,\nBelieving I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years,\nWaiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the sun,\nMaking a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in the circle of obis,\nHelping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,\nDancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist,\nDrinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas admirant, minding the Koran,\nWalking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum,\nAccepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine,\nTo the mass kneeling or the puritan’s prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a pew,\nRanting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me,\nLooking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land,\nBelonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.\n\nOne of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey.\n\nDown-hearted doubters dull and excluded,\nFrivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten’d, atheistical,\nI know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief.\n\nHow the flukes splash!\nHow they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!\n\nBe at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,\nI take my place among you as much as among any,\nThe past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,\nAnd what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the same.\n\nI do not know what is untried and afterward,\nBut I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.\n\nEach who passes is consider’d, each who stops is consider’d, not a single one can it fail.\n\nIt cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,\nNor the young woman who died and was put by his side,\nNor the little child that peep’d in at the door, and then drew back and was never seen again,\nNor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall,\nNor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,\nNor the numberless slaughter’d and wreck’d, nor the brutish koboo call’d the ordure of humanity,\nNor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in,\nNor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth,\nNor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them,\nNor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.\n\n44\n\nIt is time to explain myself—let us stand up.\n\nWhat is known I strip away,\nI launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.\n\nThe clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate?\n\nWe have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,\nThere are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.\n\nBirths have brought us richness and variety,\nAnd other births will bring us richness and variety.\n\nI do not call one greater and one smaller,\nThat which fills its period and place is equal to any.\n\nWere mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?\nI am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,\nAll has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,\n(What have I to do with lamentation?)\n\nI am an acme of things accomplish’d, and I an encloser of things to be.\n\nMy feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,\nOn every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps,\nAll below duly travel’d, and still I mount and mount.\n\nRise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,\nAfar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,\nI waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,\nAnd took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.\n\nLong I was hugg’d close—long and long.\n\nImmense have been the preparations for me,\nFaithful and friendly the arms that have help’d me.\n\nCycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,\nFor room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,\nThey sent influences to look after what was to hold me.\n\nBefore I was born out of my mother generations guided me,\nMy embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.\n\nFor it the nebula cohered to an orb,\nThe long slow strata piled to rest it on,\nVast vegetables gave it sustenance,\nMonstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care.\n\nAll forces have been steadily employ’d to complete and delight me,\nNow on this spot I stand with my robust soul.\n\n45\n\nO span of youth! ever-push’d elasticity!\nO manhood, balanced, florid and full.\n\nMy lovers suffocate me,\nCrowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,\nJostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,\nCrying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my head,\nCalling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,\nLighting on every moment of my life,\nBussing my body with soft balsamic busses,\nNoiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.\n\nOld age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!\n\nEvery condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows after and out of itself,\nAnd the dark hush promulges as much as any.\n\nI open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,\nAnd all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems.\n\nWider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,\nOutward and outward and forever outward.\n\nMy sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,\nHe joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,\nAnd greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.\n\nThere is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,\nIf I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run,\nWe should surely bring up again where we now stand,\nAnd surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.\n\nA few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span or make it impatient,\nThey are but parts, any thing is but a part.\n\nSee ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,\nCount ever so much, there is limitless time around that.\n\nMy rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,\nThe Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,\nThe great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there.\n\n46\n\nI know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be measured.\n\nI tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)\nMy signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods,\nNo friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,\nI have no chair, no church, no philosophy,\nI lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,\nBut each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,\nMy left hand hooking you round the waist,\nMy right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.\n\nNot I, not any one else can travel that road for you,\nYou must travel it for yourself.\n\nIt is not far, it is within reach,\nPerhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,\nPerhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.\n\nShoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,\nWonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.\n\nIf you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip,\nAnd in due time you shall repay the same service to me,\nFor after we start we never lie by again.\n\nThis day before dawn I ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven,\nAnd I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we be fill’d and satisfied then?\nAnd my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.\n\nYou are also asking me questions and I hear you,\nI answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.\n\nSit a while dear son,\nHere are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,\nBut as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.\n\nLong enough have you dream’d contemptible dreams,\nNow I wash the gum from your eyes,\nYou must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life.\n\nLong have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,\nNow I will you to be a bold swimmer,\nTo jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.\n\n47\n\nI am the teacher of athletes,\nHe that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,\nHe most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.\n\nThe boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power, but in his own right,\nWicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,\nFond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,\nUnrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts,\nFirst-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull’s eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo,\nPreferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over all latherers,\nAnd those well-tann’d to those that keep out of the sun.\n\nI teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?\nI follow you whoever you are from the present hour,\nMy words itch at your ears till you understand them.\n\nI do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat,\n(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of you,\nTied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen’d.)\n\nI swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,\nAnd I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air.\n\nIf you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,\nThe nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves a key,\nThe maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.\n\nNo shutter’d room or school can commune with me,\nBut roughs and little children better than they.\n\nThe young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,\nThe woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day,\nThe farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,\nIn vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen and love them.\n\nThe soldier camp’d or upon the march is mine,\nOn the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,\nOn that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.\n\nMy face rubs to the hunter’s face when he lies down alone in his blanket,\nThe driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,\nThe young mother and old mother comprehend me,\nThe girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,\nThey and all would resume what I have told them.\n\n48\n\nI have said that the soul is not more than the body,\nAnd I have said that the body is not more than the soul,\nAnd nothing, not God, is greater to one than one’s self is,\nAnd whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud,\nAnd I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,\nAnd to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times,\nAnd there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero,\nAnd there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel’d universe,\nAnd I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.\n\nAnd I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,\nFor I who am curious about each am not curious about God,\n(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.)\n\nI hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,\nNor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.\n\nWhy should I wish to see God better than this day?\nI see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,\nIn the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,\nI find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign’d by God’s name,\nAnd I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe’er I go,\nOthers will punctually come for ever and ever.\n\n49\n\nAnd as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me.\n\nTo his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,\nI see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,\nI recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,\nAnd mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.\n\nAnd as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not offend me,\nI smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,\nI reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish’d breasts of melons.\n\nAnd as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,\n(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)\n\nI hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,\nO suns—O grass of graves—O perpetual transfers and promotions,\nIf you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?\n\nOf the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,\nOf the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,\nToss, sparkles of day and dusk—toss on the black stems that decay in the muck,\nToss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.\n\nI ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,\nI perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,\nAnd debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.\n\n50\n\nThere is that in me—I do not know what it is—but I know it is in me.\n\nWrench’d and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes,\nI sleep—I sleep long.\n\nI do not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid,\nIt is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.\n\nSomething it swings on more than the earth I swing on,\nTo it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.\n\nPerhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.\n\nDo you see O my brothers and sisters?\nIt is not chaos or death—it is form, union, plan—it is eternal life—it is Happiness.\n\n51\n\nThe past and present wilt—I have fill’d them, emptied them,\nAnd proceed to fill my next fold of the future.\n\nListener up there! what have you to confide to me?\nLook in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,\n(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)\n\nDo I contradict myself?\nVery well then I contradict myself,\n(I am large, I contain multitudes.)\n\nI concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.\n\nWho has done his day’s work? who will soonest be through with his supper?\nWho wishes to walk with me?\n\nWill you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?\n\n52\n\nThe spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering.\n\nI too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,\nI sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\n\nThe last scud of day holds back for me,\nIt flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds,\nIt coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.\n\nI depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,\nI effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.\n\nI bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,\nIf you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\n\nYou will hardly know who I am or what I mean,\nBut I shall be good health to you nevertheless,\nAnd filter and fibre your blood.\n\nFailing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,\nMissing me one place search another,\nI stop somewhere waiting for you."}

when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,\nLost in the loving floating ocean of thee,\nLaved in the flood of thy bliss O death.\n\nFrom me to thee glad serenades,\nDances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee,\nAnd the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fitting,\nAnd life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.\n\nThe night in silence under many a star,\nThe ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,\nAnd the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil’d death,\nAnd the body gratefully nestling close to thee.\n\nOver the tree-tops I float thee a song,\nOver the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide,\nOver the dense-pack’d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,\nI float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death.\n\n15\n\nTo the tally of my soul,\nLoud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,\nWith pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.\n\nLoud in the pines and cedars dim,\nClear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,\nAnd I with my comrades there in the night.\n\nWhile my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,\nAs to long panoramas of visions.\n\nAnd I saw askant the armies,\nI saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,\nBorne through the smoke of the battles and pierc’d with missiles I saw them,\nAnd carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,\nAnd at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)\nAnd the staffs all splinter’d and broken.\n\nI saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,\nAnd the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,\nI saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,\nBut I saw they were not as was thought,\nThey themselves were fully at rest, they suffer’d not,\nThe living remain’d and suffer’d, the mother suffer’d,\nAnd the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer’d,\nAnd the armies that remain’d suffer’d.\n\n16\n\nPassing the visions, passing the night,\nPassing, unloosing the hold of my comrades’ hands,\nPassing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,\nVictorious song, death’s outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,\nAs low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night,\nSadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy,\nCovering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,\nAs that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,\nPassing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,\nI leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.\n\nI cease from my song for thee,\nFrom my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,\nO comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.\n\nYet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,\nThe song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,\nAnd the tallying chant, the echo arous’d in my soul,\nWith the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,\nWith the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,\nComrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead I loved so well,\nFor the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands—and this for his dear sake,\nLilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,\nThere in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim."}
